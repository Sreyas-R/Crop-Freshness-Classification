# Crop-Freshness-Classification
This project aims to develop a robust crop freshness classification system utilizing the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) object detection model. 
The dataset encompasses diverse leaf classes, including fresh leaves and leaves affected by specific diseases in various crops such as apples, bell peppers, corn, grapes, peaches, potatoes, raspberries, 
soybeans, strawberries, tomatoes, and others. 

The model was trained over 25 epochs, showcasing a steady decline in the loss function, indicating effective convergence. 
This aligns with the YOLOv8 architecture's ability to learn intricate patterns and features from the dataset.

The trained model demonstrated robust performance on both the training and validation datasets, achieving an overall accuracy of 70%. Precision, recall, and F1-score metrics were consistently high, illustrating the model's efficacy in distinguishing between fresh and diseased leaves.
